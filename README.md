# DAND-Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data
Project 7 on Udacity Data analysis 


## Introduction 

Real-world data rarely comes clean
I am using Python and its libraries, I gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling.

The dataset that I am wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.
